## Introduction to Open Data Science

After completing this course I should be able to understand the principles and advantages of using open research tools with open data and understand the possibilities of reproducible research. I should know how to use R, R Studio, R markdown, and GitHub for these tasks and also know how to learn more of these open software tools. I should also know how to apply certain statistical methods of data science, that is, data-driven statistics.
