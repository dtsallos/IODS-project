# 1^st^ Week

*Tools and methods for open and reproducible research*

During the first week we went through the general instructions of the course, deadlines, tools to learn etc.- and start working! We get familiar with R, RStudio and GitHub. We create our own GitHub repository: a place on the web to store your course codes and analyses.
